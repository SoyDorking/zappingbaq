# Front-End Test

This is just a simple Front-End Test for Developer candidates. The goal is to test your ability in a few key areas:
- HTML & CSS
- JavaScript
- Code Organization
- Commit Quality

Attention to detail is crucial, so be sure to read the following instructions carefully!

# HTML & CSS
**very_messy.css:**
- Oh no! It seems that the previous Developer was in a hurry and made quite a big mess... can you fix it?
- Organize _very-messy.css_. It should follow the same coding standards and indentations as the theme's CSS file.
- That rascal used _!important_ needlessly. Can you remove them?
- While you're at it, why not merge its code into the right CSS file? Once that's done, remove that messy file.

**Header:**
- The "Infinite Loop" logo should be on the right side. The main menu on the left.
- In the hamburger menu, make each link full width and left aligned.

**Contact Us:**
- The client wants the form on the right side.
- The "Submit" button should be full width.

# Javascript
- The main menu is broken in tablet resolutions. Trigger the responsive hamburger menu on tablet resolutions.
- Right now, the only way to close the hamburger menu is when you click on the hamburger icon. Expand its functionality so that it automatically closes when you press outside the menu area.

# Code Organization & Standards
- It's important to make sure your code is properly **indented** and **formatted**. Not only will it make it easier to quickly read and understand your code, it's also considerate towards your fellow Developers. No one likes messy code.
- **DO**. **NOT**. **USE**. **IMPORTANTS**. **LIGHTLY**.
- Although the _!important_ property has its place in CSS, do not use it lightly.

# Quality Commits
- Making clear and concise commits is crucial (whether you're working in a team or just by yourself). Good commit messages make it easier for everyone to understand what's happening by taking a quick look at the repository's history (that includes future you).
- Read this [wonderful resource](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) on how to write nice, clean commits.
- After you're done with this test, you'll be ready to push your various commits (one for each fix, requested feature or change) to the repository.
- Hopefully you read the entire instructions before getting to this point.

Good luck! I look forward to reviewing your work!
